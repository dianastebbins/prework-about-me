      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a UW grad (go Dawgs!), married and a mom.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>My parents moved from Utah to Seattle when I was three. Other than a short while living in southern California, I have grown up and lived most of my life in the Seattle area.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Most of all I like hanging out with my family and whatever activity we are currently immersed in. I love making things with my hands so I like anything crafty. I also enjoy finding shows or movie franchises to binge watch.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something challenging but fun and with a company that looks to the future and keeping up with it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I live in Maple Valley.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My current job title for the last year has been Business Analyst but I'm not really in love with the work. Prior to that I was a software developer but worked on applications that were pretty far behind technology-wise. I really enjoyed development when it was "fresher" so I am working to update my skills and then move forward in my career.</p>
